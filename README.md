# CANtact Hardware

CANtact is a low-cost, open-source CAN bus interface hardware design, designed specifically for automotive diagnostics, industrial automation, and embedded systems development.

Also available at distributors:

CANtact is a high-end CAN bus interface tool based on the original CANtact design, with optimization focused in rough order on (1) reliability, (2) ease of use, (3) cost-effectiveness, and finally (4) expandability. This results in a tool that covers many automotive and industrial use-cases, making it accessible for hobbyists and professionals alike.

As an open-source project and as a remix of the original CANtact design, it also collects inputs from various community members, and welcomes your contributions!
